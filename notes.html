SIMPLE LOGGIC BEHIND LOADING A WEB PAGE
    1)client requests url to server
    2)server serves the index.html
    3)index.html links to all the static files(fonts, images, stylesheets,favicon)
    4)client will make network request for all those static files

NEW KNOWLEDGE
    1)arrow funcs need to be exported at the end of the file
    2)"react/prop-types":"off"

PROJECT 1 - FANCY COUNTER
    CREATE PROJECT WITH VITE
        npm create vite@version
        npm install
        npm run dev

    PAKCHAGE JSON
        All important information about the project(versions, commands, dependencies)

    ESLINT
        Can install extension but config file will take precedence.

    HOW CAN PEOPLE GET NODE_MODULES
        npm install
            installs dependencies on the package.json
        .gitignore
            holds the node_modules so they are not commited or shared

    WHERE TO STORE IMAGES
        src
            assets
                if they are referenced
        public
            if they are not referenced

    AUTO IMPORTS
        ctrl+enter -> should pop up intellisense

PROEJECT 2 - WORD ANALYTICS
    TO LEARN
        Character analyzer to see how many characters are left in a post for social media.
    
    CREATE PROJECT
        npm create vite@version . 

    TRIIGGER INTELLISENSE
        ctrl + space
        enter

    REMEMBER SEMANTIC HTML
        <header>
        <footer>
        <main>
        <section>

    REMEMBER RETURN
        return from negative paths to prevent rest of code to execute
        
    DON'T NEED TO ADD MORE STATE
        Analyze if states are very closely related and eliminate one. 
        Boolean state is not necessary, we can condition with trushy and falsy states.
    
    DERIVED STATE
        Calculations based on an existing state.
        Avoids overpopulating with more states.

    LIFTING STATE UP 
        To parent component that can distribute to all children in need.

    PASSING PROPS AS DESTRUCTURED OBJECT
        Passing a lot of props gets messy and tedious.

        const stats = {
            numberOfWords: text.split(/\s/).filter((word) => word !== "").length,
            numberOfCharacters: text.length,
            instagramCharactersLeft: 280 - text.length,
            facebookCharactersLeft: 2200 - text.length,
        };

        <Stats
            {...stats}
        />

    CONDITIONAL STYLING IN REACT
        className={`original clases ${var ? "classToRender" : ""}`}

    EXTRACTING CONSTANTS IN SEPARATE FILE
        Every single constant value, in separate constants.js file.
        
        EXAMPLE
            export const INSTAGRAM_MAX_CHARACTERS = 280
            export const FACEBOOK_MAX_CHARACTERS = 280
    
    FOLDER STRUCTURE
        paths must be relative to the main.jsx

        COMPONENTS
            all react components
        LIB
            constants
            hooks
            utilites
