PROJECT 1 - FANCY COUNTER
    CREATE PROJECT WITH VITE
        npm create vite@version
        npm install
        npm run dev

    PAKCHAGE JSON
        All important information about the project(versions, commands, dependencies)

    ESLINT
        Can install extension but config file will take precedence.

    HOW CAN PEOPLE GET NODE_MODULES
        npm install
            installs dependencies on the package.json
        .gitignore
            holds the node_modules so they are not commited or shared

    WHERE TO STORE IMAGES
        src
            assets
                if they are referenced
        public
            if they are not referenced

    AUTO IMPORTS
        ctrl+enter -> should pop up intellisense

PROEJECT 2 - WORD ANALYTICS

    REMEMBER SEMANTIC HTML
        <header>
        <footer>
        <main>
        <section>

    REMEMBER RETURN
        return from negative paths to prevent rest of code to execute
        
    DON'T NEED TO ADD MORE STATE
        Analyze if states are very closely related and eliminate one. 
        Boolean state is not necessary, we can condition with trushy and falsy states.
    
    DERIVED STATE
        Calculations based on an existing state.
        Avoids overpopulating with more states.

    LIFTING STATE UP 
        To parent component that can distribute to all children in need.

    PASSING PROPS AS DESTRUCTURED OBJECT
        Passing a lot of props gets messy and tedious.

        const stats = {
            numberOfWords: text.split(/\s/).filter((word) => word !== "").length,
            numberOfCharacters: text.length,
            instagramCharactersLeft: 280 - text.length,
            facebookCharactersLeft: 2200 - text.length,

INTERMEDIATE REACT & JAVASCRIPT
    ARRAYS - INTERMEDIATE
        push
        length
        .forEach
        item[#]
    OBJECTS - INTERMEDIATE
        nested objects
        property shorthands
    ARRAYS - ADVANCED
        .push()
        .map() - returns new array - always specify return keyword
        .some() - returns true if at least 1 element fulfills condition - always specify return keyword
        .find() - returns 1st element or undefined - always specify return keyword
        .filter() - returns new array with elements that specify condition - always specify return keyword
    
    OBJECTS - ADVANCED
        bracker notation 
            object[property]
    SPREAD OPERATOR
        const totalArry = [...arr, ...arr2]
    DESTRUCTURING
        const {name} = user -> must be same name
        const [anything] = cart -> order is what matters
    PRIMITIVES VS REFERENCES
        only primitives can be compared(== || ===)
        reference -> you get pointers to where the data is stored -> thats why they can't be compared
    SHORT CIRCUITING && --
        && -> super consice if this is true, run the right part.
        || -> if first is true, stop there. If first is false, run second.
    FUNCTIONS - INTERMEDIATE
        order of execution 
        refactoring -> get rid of redundant code always
        early return -> stops function execution
    FUNCTIONS - ADVANCED
        callbacks -> function as parameter
        method -> function on something
            this keyword only works on traditional function (not arrows)
        default param
            could avoid undefinde in a math operation
    FETCH - INTRO
        words we can type without error are browser included:
            fetch()
        json -> syntad used by client - server communication 
            readable
            supported by most prog-langs
        .then()
            handles a promise -> must return 
        .catch()
            handles errors from the server
        if(!res.ok) -> method that comes with fetch promise -> indicates if response status is in the 200s. This is necessary b/c .catch won;t always catch all errors.
        
    ASYNC - AWAIT
        More modern syntax

        try{
            res = await fetch 
            data = await res
        }
        catch{

        ensures popular hooks are used correctly following react guidelines.

    LOOP
        ALWAYS loop when you are repeating your code.

        more professional

    IMPLEMENTATION LOGIC AND STATE IN 1 PLACE
        Standard practice to keep in 1 place:
            state
            derived state
                normal arithmetic logic on existing state
            logic handlers

    onEvent - onHandleEvent
        When the prop reaches the component that will make use of it,change naming to onEvent to keep html standards.

    SORTING
        1)place component
            React-Select Library
                Represents a whole new approach to developing powerful React.js components that just work out of the box, while being extremely customisable.
        2)Set props
            onChange
            options
            setDefaultValue
        3)make UI change depending on the sortState
            create sort state
            sort array
            map sorted array 
    
    LOCALSTORAGE
        Store items
        UseEffect
        initialize state with return from lc || initial data if lc empty

    USEMEMO
        hook in react to avoid doing recalculation by storing a computation in memory until dependencies change. 
        SYNTAX
            Same useEffefcct syntax
        WHY
            Avoid recalculating taxing stuff on every re render, only when deps change.
        SIMILAR TO
            not wanting to run useeffect on every re render b/c of performance


    CHILDREN COMPOSITION
        Pretty much just move the components higher and bloat up higher to avoid prop drilling.

    CONTEXT
        Hook that allows for the transport of information. 

        1)CREATE CONTEXT COMPONENT
            <ItemsContextProvider>
            1.1)Outside that component definition createContext
                const ItemsContext = createContext()

            1.2)return the context.provider
                return(
                    <ItemsContext.Provider value={{objWithData}}>{children}</ItemsContext.Provider>
                )
        2)WRAP ELEMENTS WITH CONTEXT
            <ItemsContextProvider>
                <everything else>
            </ItemsContextProvider>
        3)export and consume the context from somewhere
            1)export it from the file where it was created
                export ItemsContext = createContext()
            2)consume it
                const {this,that} = useContext(ItemsContext)

        PROBLEMS
            No selectors, meaning every component attached to a part of context will always render if 1 of them change. 
            Big apps will need A LOT of context providers. That will mean a lot of boilerplate code and wrapping of components. 
            Middleware and advanced, context is limited. 
            

    CUSTOM HOOKS
        Regular js function that encompasses and makes use of a hook.

        STRUCTURE
            lib
                hook.js

        EXAMPLE
            export function useItemsContext() {
                const context = useContext(ItemsContext)

                if(!context) {
                    throw new Error
                }
                return context
            }
        BENEFITS
            1 import instead of 2(useContext, itemsContext)
            easier to write useItemsContext() instead of useContext(ItemsContext)
            when using typescript will have to account for situation in which context returns nothing.This logic can be handled here
        
        
    ZUSTAND 
        State management library for react providing simple, lightweight, flexible alternative to redux. 

        BENEFITS
            ease of use
            minimal boilerplate
            powerful capabilities

        WHY IT WORKS WELL
            simplicity
                intuitive and no strict pattern
            performance 
                no unnecessary re-renders
            no context provider hell
                no context api use, so no context provider hell
            versatility
                supports both local and global state management, suitable for different scale applications
            merging of state
                dont have to spread the store object, only the modified part will be changed.
                No need to specify {...store, propToChange: newValue}

        INSTALL 
            npm install zustand

        WHERE
            stores(folder)
                itemsStore.js/ts

        HOW
            Creates a store for managing state. 

            1)store creation
                create function to define state and actions.  

                import create from 'zustand'
            
                const useStore = create((set) => {
                    bears:0,
                    increasePopulation: () => set((state) => ({bears: state.bears + 1})) -> previous State needed, set receives it as parameter
                    removeAllBears: () => set({bears: 0})                                -> no prev state needed, just replace the state.
                    updateBears: (newBears) => set({bears: newBears})                    -> payload from outside needed. Main function receives as param. 
                })
            *)export store
                const export useItemStore = create((set) => ({store}))

            2)accessing the store 
                inside component
                    const bears = useStore((state) => state.bears)
                    const increasePopulation = useStore((state) => state.increasePopulation)

            3)state update
                zustand uses "set" function to update state. 
                Reactive updates: only parts using the affected parts will re render.
            4)middleware support
                supports middleware like extending state or logging changes.
            
        ADVANCED FEATURES
            1)selectors
                derived state
                pick specific parts of the store
            2)middleware
                you can enhance the store with middleware for logging, persistance or async actions.

        WHEN
            small - medium sized applications
            simple alternative to redux
            global state managemnt NO boilerplate
            avoiding limits of context API

        WHERE ZUSTAND SHINES
            NO PROVIDER COMPONENT HELL
            NO UNNECESARY RE RENDER
            NO NEED TO SPREAD STATE, MORE DECLARATIVE PROGRAMMING
            SIMPLE TO SET AND USE
            SMALL,MID,LARGE PROJECTS 
            AVANCED MIDDLEWARE like persist for localstorage
            
TYPESCRIPT IN REACT
    IN COMPONENT PROPS:
        MAINTAINS CONSISTENCY IN PROPS GIVEN AND NEEDED
            Instance
                Given props not defined in component definition will return error.
                    Property 'pillshape' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & ButtonProps'
                Missing props defined but not given will remind the user they are needed.
                   Type '{}' is missing the following properties from type 'ButtonProps': backgroundColor, fontSize, pillShapets(2739)

            Definition
                Defined props not used, will return error.
                    'backgroundColor' is defined but never used
            
            INTELLISENSE
                ctrl+space
                    Ts will show all the possible props that the component is expecting

        DEFINING PROP TYPES
            Since prop is an object, prop types will be for objects.

            SYNTAX 1 - INLINE
                export default function Button({backgroundColor,fontSize pillShape}:{backgroundColor:string, fontSize:number, pillShape: boolean}) {
                    return (
                        <button>
                            ...
                        </button>
                    );
                }

            SYNTAX 2 - EXTRACTED PROP TYPE
                Declare type outside of component definition

                type ButtonProps = {backgroundColor:string, fontSize:number, pillShape: boolean}

                export default function Button({backgroundColor,fontSize, pillShape}:ButtonProps) {
                    return (
                        <button className="bg-blue-500 text-white rounded px-4 py-2">
                        Click me
                        </button>
                    );
                }

                EXTRACTED UNION TYPE FOR ALREADY EXTRACTED PROP TYPE
                    type Color = "red" | "blue" | "green"
                    type ButtonProps = {backgroundColor: Color, fontSize:number, pillShape: boolean}


        OPTIONAL PROP 
            type ButtonProps = {backgroundColor:string, fontSize:number, pillShape?: boolean}

        ARRAY TYPE FOR PROP
            type ButtonProps = {backgroundColor: Color[], fontSize:number, pillShape: boolean, padding: number[]}

        TUPLE TYPE FOR PROP
            Will determine:
                1)specific number of elements
                2)type of each specific element

            type ButtonProps = {backgroundColor: Color[], fontSize:number, pillShape: boolean, padding: [number, number, number]}
            <Button padding: [44,33,22]/> -> only 3 elements b/c that is what is defined in the tuple 

        USING AND OBJECT FOR STYLE INSTEAD OF INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES
            MANUAL 
                type ButtonProps = {
                    style: {
                        backgroundColor: string,
                        fontSize: number
                        etc
                    }
                }

                <Button style={{backgroundColor: "blue", fontSize: 24}}/>
            
            REACT CSS PROPERTIES TYPE
                type ButtonProps = {
                    style: React.CSSProperties
                }

                WHY?
                    Permits use to pass an object filled with actual css properties in the component instance AND AVOID writing all of them in the type created, b/c this is already done by React.
                    Will tell you if you wrote incorrectly a property in the instance, since it will not exist in the interface created by react
                    Will tell you if the value you wrote is incorrect, since it is already defined in he interface what values are permited.

        GENERICS IN PROP TYPES
            type ButtonProps = {
                borderRadius: Record<string, number>
            }

            <Button borderRadius={{
                topLeft: 5,
                topRight: 5, 
                bottomRight:10,
                bottomLeft:10
            }}/>

        TYPES FOR FUNCTION PROPS
            Create and pass the function
                const onClick = (test:string) => 5
                <Button onClick={onClick}/> 

            Specify parameters and their types and return type
                type ButtonProps = {
                    onClick: (test: string) => number
                }

        ComponentProps<"element"> 
            This line means that ButtonProps will inherit all the props of a native HTML <button> element.

            ComponentProps: 
                This utility type extracts the props of a given React component or an HTML intrinsic element (like "button", "div", etc.).

            <"button">: 
                This specifies which component or HTML element you want to extract props from. In this case, it's the intrinsic "button" element.

            HOW
                HTML elements in React, such as <button>, have predefined props, like onClick, disabled, and so on.
                ComponentProps<"button"> automatically generates the type definition for these props, so you don't need to manually define them. 
                
            EXAMPLE
                type ButtonProps = ComponentProps<'button'>

                ONLY SPEAD(...PROPS)
                    const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = (props) => {
                        return <button {...props}>{props.children}</button>    
                    }

                REST OP(...REST)
                const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({type, autoFocus, ...rest}) => {
                    return <button type={type}, autoFocus={autoFocus}, {...rest}>{props.children}</button>    
                }
                
                <Button type="submit" autoFocus={true} defaultValue="test"/>

            HELPER(UTILITY) TYPES
                Predefined types that simplify common type manipulation.
                
                Syntax for Helper Types:
                    Helper types typically use generics. For example:
                        type MyType<T> = Partial<T>;

                COMMONLY USED 
                    Partial<T>: Makes all properties of a type optional.
                        type Person = { name: string; age: number };
                        type OptionalPerson = Partial<Person>;
                        // { name?: string; age?: number }
                    Required<T>: Makes all properties of a type required.
                        type OptionalPerson = { name?: string; age?: number };
                        type FullPerson = Required<OptionalPerson>;
                        // { name: string; age: number }
                    Readonly<T>: Makes all properties read-only.
                        type Person = { name: string; age: number };
                        type ReadonlyPerson = Readonly<Person>;
                        // { readonly name: string; readonly age: number }
                    Pick<T, K>: Picks specific keys from a type.
                        type Person = { name: string; age: number; location: string };
                        type NameAndAge = Pick<Person, "name" | "age">;
                        // { name: string; age: number }
                    Omit<T, K>: Excludes specific keys from a type.
                        type Person = { name: string; age: number; location: string };
                        type WithoutLocation = Omit<Person, "location">;
                        // { name: string; age: number }
                    Record<K, T>: Creates a type with keys K and values of type T.
                        type RolePermissions = Record<"admin" | "editor" | "viewer", boolean>;
                        // { admin: boolean; editor: boolean; viewer: boolean }
                
        INTERSECTION 
            Way to combine multiple types into a single type including all properties and methods of each constituent type. (&)

            EXAMPLE
                Situation to determine the props for a regular element and then inrtersect with something extra for another element.

                type = ButtonProps = {
                    type: "button" | "submit" | "reset",
                    color: "red" | "blue" | "green"
                }
                type SuperButtonProps = ButtonProps & {
                    size: "md" | "lg"
                }

            EXAMPLE FOR INTERFACE
                type SuperButtonProps extends ButtonProps {
                    size: "md" | "lg"
                }

    IN EVENT HANDLERS
        INLINE
            Ts can infer the type of the parameters of inline handlers.

            EXAMPLE
            <button onClick = (e) => console.log("clicked")> 
            TYPE: event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement, MouseEvent>

        EXTRACTED
            No longer infered, must define manual.

            const handleClick = (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement, MouseEvent>) => console.log("clicked")

    WITH STATE
        Ts can infer the type with the default value. 
        Manual definition of type can also be done.

        EXAMPLE
            useState<number>(3)

        WITH NULL INITIATION
            1)Make sure the type is defined and unioned with null
                type User = {
                    name:string
                }
                const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null)
            
            2)Guard clause for when the state is actually null
                const name = user?.name

    WITH USEREF
        const ref = useRef<HTMLButtonElement>(null)
    
    AS CONST
        Makes an inferred type a literal typ
        Makes the type a readonly

    ASSERT
        Explicitly giving a type to something ts has inferred.

        type ButtonColor = "red" | "blue" | "green"

        useEffect(() => {
            const previousButtonColor = localStorage.getItem("buttonColor") as ButtonColor
        }, [])

    GENERICS
        With react, must have a comma after defining the generic type. 
            <T,> this is so ts does not confuse this with an html element

        INLINE
            function ConvertToArray <T> (contValue: T): T[] {  
                ...              
                }
        EXTRACTED
            type ButtonProps<T> = {
                countValue:T,
                countHistory: T[]    
            }
            export default function Button<T>({countValue, countHistory}: ButtonProps<T>)

    EXPORT AND IMPORT
        EXPORT
            LIB folder  
                types.ts 
                    export type Color = "red" | "green" | "blue"

        IMPORT 
            import {type Color} from "@/lib/types"
            

    UNKNOWN
        Some situations where data is unknown, ts will default to any(e.g. Fetching from an API)

        .then((response) => response.json())
        .then((data:unknown) => console.log(data))

        ZOD
            Following the example above, we can parse the data through zod to ensure it will be the particular form we thought it would be. 
            
    IN COMPONENT RETURN TYPE
        Ts can infer the return type of a react element.

            Where prop is sent
                Receives type as union number | string
            Where prop is used
                Props is defined as what it should be ideally
        PROB
            Both come into conflict and must be addressed
        SOLU
            Tuple will provide ideal type for each
                return [jobItemsSliced,isLoading] as const
    Key Prop
        Funny enough, it must be given but react won't pass it. 
        It won't be received on the component definition side. 
    Type Form
        searchText: string
        setSearchText: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateFunction<string>>.
2)JOB DETAILS
    Keep track of active job Id
        WHY 
            1)style based on active job
            2)share current id for page to load in that state
        URL HASH
            fulfills requirements to share and load.
            state will lose its value on initial load.

            WRITING
                <a href={`#${jobItem.id}`}
                HOW
                    Window.location.href gets or sets the url.
                    Anchor tags href prop has access to the window.location.href   
            READING
                Tap into hashchange event with an event listener.
                WHERE
                    UseEffect
                HOW
                    window.addEventListener("hashchange", () => {...})
        Initially call to handlehaschange
            if there is something in the hash
            useEffect runs the function without need for hashchange event

            PRO
                Avoids need to set initial value | null in state


        STATE
            const [activeId, setActiveId] = useState<number | null>(null) 
            WHERE
                app, b/c jobList and jobItemContent need it
            WHY
                Hash alone won't cause re renders, it is for data persistance only.
            
    useActiveId custom Hook
        Objective
            Group all logic related to this feature in a single place
        Benefit
            1)De clutter main app or files unnecessary for this
            2)If implementation wants to be changed, only 1 place to work on
    Fetch jobItemContent(Custom Hook)
        WHEN 
            activeId changes
        REMEMBER
            onClick for specific jobItem already deals with changing the hash and the activeId state. We can work with reacting to this change. 
        guardClause
            !activeId return
        Types consistency is enforced
            A type defined before (activeID = number | null) will force you to keep that same type and work around it.

            EXAMPLE
                useJobItemContent(activeId: number | null)
                    type narrow the null case with guard clasue
                    only number type is left to deal with
    type JobItemContent
        perfect example of type intersection
            export type JobItemContent = JobItem & {
            ... extra
        }
        Initial type for JobItemContet useState
            JobItemContent | null
            WHY
                When initialized, there is a scenario in which the fetch is not run b/c activId is not there and has not changed. 
                    In this situation we work with null.

            Guard clause
                Rememember to always guard clause a null state
            Prop does not exist on type never Error
                Error message when state is initialized empty and is not unioned with the actual type
        Importing same name type as component
            import {type JobItemContent}
    Render JobItemContent
        Render EmptyJobContent
            if !JobItemContent return <EmptyJobContent/>
    isLoading
        Multiple isLoading must be in separate files. 
    Style active jobListItem
        inside jobListItem
            useActiveId c-hook
            isActive={activdeId == jobItem.id} -> conditionally render prop to produce boolean value
    ResultsCount
        derived state in useJobItems hook where info is readily available
3)Debounce searchText
    Obj
        Limit api fetch until user has finished typing in input
    HOW
        Fetch with a debounced searchText
    
    STEPS
        useEffect(() => {
            const timerId = setTimeout(() => setDebouncedSearchText(searchText), 1000)
            return () => clearTimeout(timerId)
        },[searchText])
    type with generics
        useDebounce<T>(value:T,delay = 1000):T
    Default params
        Perfect use for a standard delay unless user specifies.
4)Changing fetch to React-Query
    Obj
       Store recently fetched data to avoid re fetching
    WHERE
        1)jobItems
        2)jobItemContent
    PROVIDER
        Establish a provider in the main file with <App>
    FETCHER FUNCTION
        Extracted named function 
    type assertion for null case of a type 
        Good way to deal with the datatype | null guard clause
    typing data from react query
        SOLU
            type data returned from fetcher function
    typing fetch function 
        Promise<JobItemContent>
    Error handling
        Pass the error
        Use the error
            onError: (error) => {
                console.log(error)
            } 
    Purify the function
        Remove derived states to maintain the function pure
    Refactor the useJobItems Hook
        Possibility of undefined
            If funcion is never run, the returned data could be undefined. 
            SOLUTION
                Just like before, give it an initial value.
            EXAMPLE
                initialData: [], // Ensures data starts as an empty array
            WHAT HAPPENS
                Data will never be undefined, always empty array or full array
        Possibility of undefined values that are being sent with one data type | undefined and where they are used they are defined as without undefined.
            Short circuit the negative case scenario
                const jobItemsSliced = jobItems?.slice(0 ,ITEMS_PER_PAGE) || []
                 const jobItemsCount = jobItems?.length || 0
4)Add toast messages
    Use library
        <Toaster position="top-right"/>
        toast.error={message}
    Type narrow the message passed to toast for ts
        WHY
            React query error param is unknown type. Ts hates this.
        HOW
            let message 
            if(error instanceof Error){
            message = error.message
            }
            else if(typeof error === "string"){
            message = error
            }
            else{
            message = 'An error occured.'
            }
            toast.error(message)
        THINK OF IT THIS WAY
            ts needs proof what you are doing is allowed and you must proof it is of that type for him to allow it.
    Create error util function 
        For reusability purposes move the entire function to the utils and import in the hook.
5)Pagination
    Set the components
        import the radix arrow components
    State to store page
        const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1)
        WHERE
            App b/c jobItem to slice by page is there already.
    Create previous and next page functions for the buttons
        const handleChangePage = (pagination: 'previous' | 'next') => {
            if(pagination === 'previous'){
            setCurrentPage((prev) => prev - 1 )
            }
            else if(pagination === 'next'){
            setCurrentPage((prev) => prev + 1)
        }
        WHY
            specific due to error in providing the parameter
    render previous and next page in buttons
        send currentPage as prop to paginationControls
        {currentPage -1}{currentPage +1}
    conditionally render previos and next buttons
        previous
            {currentPage > 1 && previousButton}
        next
            derive last page
                const lastPage = jobItemsCount / ITEMS_PER_PAGE

            {currentPage < lastPAge && nextButton}
    create custom paginationButton component
        conditionslly render page and arrow based on direction 
            {direction === "previous" && (
                <>
                Page {page - 1}
                <ArrowLeftIcon />
                </>
            )}
        conditionally style the class for the next button only
            className={`pagination__button ${
                direction == "next" ? "pagination__button--next" : ""
            }`}
        type using almost same types and invoke the function 
    derived pagination state
        const lastPage = jobItemsCount / ITEMS_PER_PAGE;
    use pages to determine the slice of jobitems to render
        const jobItemsSliced =
            jobItems?.slice(
            currentPage * ITEMS_PER_PAGE - ITEMS_PER_PAGE,
            currentPage * ITEMS_PER_PAGE
        ) || [];
6)Sorting
    By:
        1)recent | daysAgo
        2)relevance | relevanceScore
    STATE
        const [sortBy, setSortBy] = useState<'relevant' | 'recent'>('relevant')
    WHERE
        App b/c it will be used to sort jobItems
    ORDER
        1)fetch
        2)sort
        3)paginate
    handleSortBy function
        const handleSortBy = (sortOption: 'relevant' | 'recent') => {
            setSortBy(sortOption)
        }
        back to first page
            setCurrentPage(1)
    style active sort option class
        sortOption === 'recent' | 'relevant' ? sorting__button--active : ""
    sort jobList based on sortBy
        [...(jobItems|[])].sort()
            To work on a brand new array and not modify the existing.
        a - b
            less to more
        b - a 
            more to less
        always specify default return like in switches
            return 0 in this case
        guard clause
            if jobItems is undefined || []
    render based on jobItemsSorted
        jobItemsSorted?.slice(pages)
    create & use SortBy & Direction types
        import { Direction, SortBy } from "../lib/types";
        export type SortBy = 'relevant' | 'recent'
        export type Direction = "previous" | "next"
    
7)Bookmarking
    WHAT
        Keep log of bookmarked jobs
    WHERE
        LocalStorage
    BookmarkIcon
        create state to store bookmarkedIcons
            const [bookmarkedIds, setBookmarkedIds] = useState<number>([])
        create handle toggleBookmarks
            if !bookmarkedIds.includes(id)
                add it 
            else
                remove it
        Context API
            WHY
                1)used in jobListItem & JobItemContent
                2)too many levels too drill app -> list -> item -> bookmarkIcon

            create context
                const BookmarkContext = createContext<BookmarkContextProps | null>(null);
                    1)bookarmedIds state
                    2)handleToogleBookmarks
            wrap context around app
                ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
                    <React.StrictMode>
                        <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
                            <BookmarkContexProvider>
                                <App />
                            </BookmarkContexProvider>
                        </QueryClientProvider>
                    </React.StrictMode>
                );

            type context & context provider
                type BookmarkContextProps = {
                    bookmarkedIds: number[]
                    handleToggleBookmark: (id:number) => void
                }
                type BookmarkContextProviderProps = {
                children: React.ReactNode
                }
            create custom hook for useBookmarkedIdsContext
                export const useBookmarkedIdsContext = () => {
                const context = useContext(BookmarkContext)
                if (!context) {
                    throw new Error(
                    "BookmarkedIds context needs to be used inside the provider"
                    );
                }
                return context;
                }
            consume context in jobListItem & JobItemContent
                const {bookmarkedIds, handleToggleBookmark} = useBookmarkedIdsContext()
        Send id to bookmark icon
            jobListItem
                <BookmarkIcon jobItemId={jobItem.id}/>
            jobItemContent
                <BookmarkIcon jobItemId={jobItemContent.id}/>
        Use toggler
            <button className="bookmark-btn" onClick={() => handleToggleBookmark(jobItemId)}>
        Conditionally stle filled class
            <BookmarkFilledIcon className={bookmarkedIds.includes(jobItemId) ? "filled" : ""}/>
        StopPropatation and preventDefault
            Anchor default behavior will always be to go to specific place.
            e.stopPropagation()
            e.preventDefault()
        Local Storage
            Write
                useEffect
                    b/c it is an exeternal system
                  useEffect(() => {
                    localStorage.setItem('bookmarkedIds', JSON.stringify(bookmarkedIds))
                }, [bookmarkedIds])
            Read
                1)read from LS
                    const bookmarksFromLocalStorage = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("bookmarkedIds") || "[]")
                WHY
                    structure of array needs to be in string before converted
                2)set initial state to the search from LS
                      const [bookmarkedIds, setBookmarkedIds] = useState<number[]>(bookmarksFromLocalStorage);
                3)change initial state to function to avoid on every re render
                    const [bookmarkedIds, setBookmarkedIds] = useState<number[]>(() => JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("bookmarkedIds") || "[]"));
        use LS custom hook 
            purpose
                1)Persist any data not only the bookmarks
                2)De clutter main app and enmcapsulate logic for reusability
            Implementation
                1)create state and initialize if reading from LS
                2)write with it on a useEffect to LS
                3)return state and setState functions
            type custom hook with generics
                export function useLocalStorage<T>(key:string, initialValue:T):[T, React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<T>>] 
                    ...
                }
        
    BookmarkButton && BookmarkPopup
        Obj
            fetch full data of job based on ids of bookmarkedIds in LS

        State controlling
            const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)
        Function toggling     
            const togglePopOver = () => {
                setIsOpen((prev) => !prev)
            }
        Conditionally rendering
            Anywhere b/c of its CSS
            {isOpen && <BookmarksPopover/>}
        Render jobList inside bookmarks popover
            <JobList jobItems={[]} isLoading={false}/>
        rename useJobItems to useSearchQuery
            Appropriate name for the function.
            UseJobItems should be the plural of useJobItemContent and work with Ids.
        create useJobItems hook to fetch multiple jobItems based on Id
            export function useJobItems(ids: number[]){
                const jobItems = useQueries({
                    queries: ids.map((id) => ({
                    queryKey: ["job-item", id],
                    queryFn: () => fetchJobItemContent(id),
                    staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 60,
                    refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
                    retry: false,
                    enabled: !!id,//on mount condition to run, if id run.
                    onError: handleUnknownError // auto passed parameter
                    })),
                })
                console.log(jobItems)
                return jobItems
            }
        Transform the result and filter out the undefined
            const jobItems = results.map((result) => result.data).filter((jobItem) => jobItem !== undefined)
        Add to context Type 
            bookmarkedJobItems: JobItemContent[]
        Create global isLoading based on individuals isLoading
              const isLoading = results.some((result) => result.isLoading)
        IN bookmarks context, use the hook with the already saved bookmarkedIds array
            const [bookmarkedJobItems, isLoading] = useJobItems(bookmarkedIds);
        Add these bookmarkedJobITems to the context to be distributed
            value={{
                bookmarkedIds, handleToggleBookmark,bookmarkedJobItems,isLoading
            }}>
        Use This newly shared bookmarkedJobItems in the BookmarkPopover
            
       LAST  modify bookmarks context to useJobItems with bookmarksId
            const {jobItems, isLoading} = useJobItems(bookmarkedIds)

         LAST consume the bookmarks context to retrieve bookmarkedIds
            const {jobItems, isLoading} = useBookmarkedIdsContext()

        Close popover on clicking outside
            Obj
                Clicking outside the popover will close it
            HOW
                Use popover as basis and whenever you click outside it, make it close.
            1)e.target.closest('.class')
                useEffect()

                        return () => {
                        document.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);
                    };
                DOWNSIDE
                    Too dependent on classes, if they change everything changes.
            2)useRef()
                create refs
                    const buttonRef = useRef<HTMLButtonElement>(null)
                    const popoverRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)
                use refs in conditionals
                    if (
                        e.target instanceof HTMLElement && 
                        !buttonRef.current?.contains(e.target) &&
                        !popoverRef.current?.contains(e.target)
                    )
                provide refs to elements
                    <button ref={buttonRef}>
                    <BookmarksPopover ref={popoverRef}/>
                consume ref on the bookmarks popover
                    const BookmarksPopover = forwardRef(function(props, ref) {
                    return <div ref={ref} </div>;
                    })
                    export default BookmarksPopover
                type the ref
                    as usual generics in the function provided by react

                    forwardRef<HTMLDivElement>
                how would you type the props
                    forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, {here}
                irony
                    typing
                        ref = 1 
                        props = 2
                    function parameters
                        props = 1
                        ref =2 
                custom hook 
                    What do we need to pass?
                        1)refs in []
                        2)function to execute
                    Iterate over refs and make 1 functin to execute for all
                        refs.every((ref) => !ref.current?.contains(e.target))
                Final Product
                    export function useClickOutside(refs, handler) {
                        useEffect(() => {
                            const handleClick = (e: MouseEvent) => {
                            if (
                                e.target instanceof HTMLElement && 
                                refs.every((ref) => !ref.current?.contains(e.target))
                            )
                                handler()
                            };
                            document.addEventListener("click", handleClick);

                            return () => {
                            document.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);
                            };
                        }, [refs, handler]);
                    }
                Type the refs and the handler
                    Typing
                        refs:React.RefObject<HTMLElement>[], handler: () => void
                    Asserting
                        e.target as Node
                    
8)Performance optimizations
    1)useActiveID
        PROBLEM
            Whenever it is used, all code will run again. 
                1)useeffect will run
                2)usestate will be created several times
                3)eventlisteners will be created several times
            Currently used in 2 places:
                1)JobItemContent(to indicate which jobItem to fetch)
                2)JobItemList(indicate which item to highlight as active)
        SOLUTION 
            Context it so only 1 exists and can be shared.
        PROCESS
            create ActiveIdContextProvider component
                1)export const ActiveIdContext = createContext<ActiveIdContext | null>(null);
                2)export default function ActiveIdContextProvider({children}: ActiveIdContextProviderProps) {
                    const activeId = useActiveId();
                    return <ActiveIdContext.Provider value={{activeId}}>
                        {children}
                    </ActiveIdContext.Provider>;
                }
            create useActiveIdContext Hook for boilerplate guard clause code
                export const useActiveIdContext = () => {
                const context = useContext(ActiveIdContext)

                if (!context) {
                    throw new Error(
                    "useActiveIdContext needs to be used inside the provider"
                    );
                }
                return context;
                }
            wrap around app
                This is where the context provider hell comes from
                    <React.StrictMode>
                        <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
                            <ActiveIdContextProvider>
                                <BookmarkContexProvider>
                                    <App />
                                </BookmarkContexProvider>
                            </ActiveIdContextProvider>
                        </QueryClientProvider>
                    </React.StrictMode>
            consume
                const {activeId} = useActiveIdContext()
                    1)JobItemContent    
                    2)JobList
        RESULT
            State is created only once
            Event listeners are attached only one
            Data is maintained pure and shared
        
    2)Pulling everything from the App component(context everything)
        PROBLEM
            state will cause anything in that component and its children to re render. (Basically all the app)
        LESSON
            Try the most you can to avoid re calculating array calculations.(very expensive)
        A)Search Text
            a)create searchTextContextProvider component
                1)move searchText and debouncedSearchText to here
                2)provide value={{searchText, debouncedSearchText, setSearchText}}
            b)create useSearchTextContext
                useContext(searchTextContext)
            c)consume useSearchTextContext everywhere we need 
                1)jobItems requres debouncedSearchText, we can't put it in app must create context
                2)form(provides searchText, setSearchText)
        B)JobItems
            a)create JobItemsContexyProvier
                1)move jobitems, sortby, currentPage
                2)provide all of it
            b)create usejobitemscontext
                useContext(jobItemsContext)
            c)consume useJobItemsContext
                1)jobList
                2)paginationControl
                3)sortingControl
                4)ResultsCounter
            d)Special case due to giving it different information
                BEFORE
                    a)app
                        We were giving it the whole joblistitemsliced
                    b)boomkarkpopover
                        We were giving it the whole bookmarkedJobItems
                NOW
                    a)App
                        <JobListSearch/>
                            Data
                                const {isLoading, jobItemsSliced} = useJobItemsContext()
                            Render
                                <JobList jobItems={jobItemsSliced} isLoading={isLoading} />
                    b)BookmarkPopover
                        Data
                            const { bookmarkedJobItems, isLoading } = useBookmarkedIdsContext();
                        Render
                            <JobList jobItems={bookmarkedJobItems} isLoading={isLoading} />
    3)useMemo(Memoize derived state)
        Efficiency in 2 steps = avoiding unnecessary
            1)re - renders
                Already worked on by encapsulating and contexting everything.
            2)computations
                There could still be some things that even if the component re renders, complete recalculation may not be necessary.
        1)Sorted case
            PROBLEM
                Since everything is in context, sorted calculation may run if page state changes and it     
            shouldn't b/c sort runs before slicing. Page changes but the items are already correctly sorted.

            SOLUTION
                Memoize unless JobItems or sortby change. No need to re run if page changes.
        2)Splice case
            PROBLEM
                None really, no case exists where this is not necessary to re run but oh well
            SOLUTION
                Memoize LOL
        3)Context Value case
            PROBLEM
                when state in context changes, return value is recalculated and all consumers re render entirely independent of what value changed b/c it recalculates all of it.
        4)Callbacking functions
            PROBLEM
                function gets re created on every render with new reference in memory, meaning the memo will detect it as a new changed one and re calculate everything. It defeats the purpose of the memo, having functions not callbacked.
            SOLUTION
                useCallback(useMemo but for functions)
                
NEW TOOLS
    React Query
        Powerful library to manage state and fetching.

        WHY
            Automaically handles all the manual things you are used to doing:
                1)loading 
                2)errors
                3)caching
                4)refetching stale info
        COMPARISON
            WITHOUT
                useEffect -> fetch
                useState -> result
                useState -> loading
                useState -> errors
                manual re fetch for stale info
            WITH
                useQuery hook
        INSTALL
            npm install @tanstack/react-query
        SETUP QUERY CLIENT IN MAIN FILE
            import {QueryClient, QueryClientProvider} from "@tanstack/react-query"

            const queryClient = new QueryClient()

            function App() {
                return(
                    <QueryClientProvider client={QueryClient}>
                        <...>
                    </QueryClientProvider>
                )
            }
            WHAT HAPPENS
                Query client wraps around your app and enables caching for all app.
        FETCH DATA WITH USEQUERY
            import {useQuery} from "@tanstack/react-query"

            function MyComponent() {
                const {data,error,isLoading} = useQuery({
                    queryKey: ['key'], 
                    queryFn: async () => {
                        const response = await fetch("https://your-api.com/data");
                        if (!response.ok) {
                        throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
                    }   
                        return response.json(); // Return the parsed JSON data
                    },
                    staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 5, 
                    cacheTime: 1000 * 60 * 10,
                    refetchOnWindowFocus: false, // 
                })
            }
            PARAMS
                queryKey                -> unique key to remember query for caching
                queryFn                 -> fn that fetches
                isLoading               -> true while fetching
                error                   -> request fails(500)
                data ->                 -> data response
                staleTime               -> (Optional) Keep data fresh
                cacheTime               -> (Optional) Keep data in cache
                refetchOnWindowFocus    -> (Optional) Prevent refetching when window regains focus
                enabled                 -> (optional) Run on mount? (boolean)
                onError                 -> func to run when error occurs 
            RETURNED
                Property	Type	        Description
                data	    Object / Array	The response data from the API.
                error	    Object / null	The error object if the request fails.
                isLoading	Boolean	        true while the query is fetching for the first time.
                isError	    Boolean	        true if an error occurred.
                isFetching	Boolean	        true if React Query is refetching data in the background.
                refetch	    Function	    A function to manually trigger a refetch.
        IMPROVEMENTS
            1)No more manual state handling(isLoading, Error, Data)
            2)Cache
            3)auto updates stale data
            4)No need for custom try catch
        DIFF isLoading vs isInitialLoading
            isLoading: 
                true when the query has no cached data and is fetching.
                This means while we haven't fetched, it is true and spinner forever.
            isInitialLoading: 
                true only while fetching and then false forever.
            RESULT
                If the query refetches (e.g., due to enabled changing or a manual refetch), isLoading might be true again, but isInitialLoading will remain false.
        INITIAL RETURNED DATA BEFORE FETCH
            React query does not know what to return, so it returns UNDEFINED.
        PLACEHOLDERDATA
            it gives React Query a temporary value (in this case, an empty array []) while the actual data is being fetched. 
            LIKE SAYING
                NOW - assume an empty array
                LATER - i'll change it after the fetch is done
            BENEFITS
                No dealing with undefined
        USEQUERIES
            Way to make several fetches in paralell instead of waterfall
            Each querie has its individual data,loading,error.

            SYNTAX
                const jobItems = useQueries({
                    queries: ids.map((id) => ({
                    queryKey: ["job-item", id],
                    queryFn: () => fetchJobItemContent(id),

            4)Custom Styling
                toast('This is a custom toast', {
                    duration: 4000,
                    position: 'top-right',
                    style: {
                        background: '#333',
                        color: '#fff',
                    },
                });

    createPortal()
        createPortal lets you render some children into a different part of the DOM.

        SYNTAX
            {createPortal(children, domNode, key?)}
        
        WHERE DOES IT END UP
            Literally outside the .root
        
LEARNED - SUMMARY
    cacheing
        storing frequently accessed data in a temp storage location to reduce retrieval time and improve performance. 
        POPULAR WAYS
            1)react-query
            2)nextjs
            3)swr vercel
    clone repo to here
        git clone https://github.com/ByteGrad/starter-rmtdev.git .
    sharing repo    
        package.json to install node_modules and avoid uploading the massive folder 
    icon to use action
        wrap icon in a button 
            example
                BookmarkIcon
                BookmarkButton
    reusability even in small components
        BookmarkIcon component 
    logo to start page
        wrap image or icon in anchor tag 
        Children prop to encapsulate html tags
    create component that will use a div to wrap around children. This encapsulates logic.
        EXAMPLE
            export function SidebarTop({children}: {children: React.ReactNode}){
                return (
                    <div className="sidebar__top">
                    {children}
                    </div>
                )
            }
    FETCHING BASED ON PURPOSE
        onLoad
            state changes and causes:
                1)component re renders
                2)new state value is given as input value
                3)new state value is used in the UI
                3)useEffect runs again and fetches based on most recent state value(last to happen)
        onReaction
            onChange(equivalent event)
    Params
        Query
            resource located, need to filter further
            example
                search
                sortBy
                limit
        Path(Route)
            locate specific resoure
    Never Type(cause by [])
        Ts type that represents a value that never occurs. 
        Expression will never produce a value.
        Ts will infer this value when initializing an empty array [].
    Loading state
        Must use 2 conditionals
        1)isLoading && <Spinner/>
            Always needed
        2)!isLoading && Data.map
            WHY?
                If is loading, then spinner AND data will map. Prevents niche cases of previous fetch data existing and new fetch being loaded.
    How custom hooks work
        HOW
            By following proper hook logic, we guarantee it will work as if it is not there
        Objective
            Group all logic related to this feature in a single place
        Benefit
            1)De clutter main app or files unnecessary for this
            2)If implementation wants to be changed, only 1 place to work on
                useEffect
                React-Query
                Other libraries
            3)Re use logic
    Returning array from custom hook
        SITUATION
            Where prop is sent
                Receives type as union number | string
            Where prop is used
                Props is defined as what it should be ideally
        PROB
            Both come into conflict and must be addressed
        SOLU
            Tuple will provide ideal type for each
                return [jobItemsSliced,isLoading] as const
    Key Prop
        Funny enough, it must be given but react won't pass it. 
        It won't be received on the component definition side. 
    Window object
        Global namespace with global variables and functions as properties.
        
        1)size and position
        2)document and DOM access
            .document  -> html DOM
            .location  -> current URL(protocol, hosty)
                1).href      -> get or set URL  
                2).reload()  -> reload page
                3).assign()  -> navigate to new URL
                4).replace() -> replaces in url in history, no back option  
            .history   -> browser session history
            .navigator -> browser and device info
    Window.location.hash
        Fragment identifier in a URL, part after the #.
        Write
            window.location.has = "jobId"
        Read
            const id=window.location.hash.substring(1)
        Reacting to hash change
            window.addEventListener("hashchange", () => {...})
    Returning function in useEffect
        Remember to clean up after side effects
        EXAMPLE
            If timeout not cleaned, will run all the timeouts of the ammounts of re renders the component had. 
    Types consistency is enforced
        A type  defined before (activeID = number | null) will force you to keep that same type and work around it. (useJobIems(activeID))
    Excellent useCase for Type Intersection
        Types where you fetch surface info on list
        And then fetch details for the details page
    Importing same name type as component
        import {type JobItemContent}
    State<type | null> and Type Narrow
        Always make sure you contemplate the null case of the state first
        When you look for something inside state, if null is not dealed with first, it will give error.
    isLoading
        Multiple isLoading must be in separate files.        
    Order of logic / conditional 
        Negatvie cases first
            isLoading?
            !var
            positive return for component
    Debounce searchText
        Technique to limit # of times a function is executed.
        Ensures function is only executed after a specific delay.
        HOW
            1)each time event is triggered, timer is set.
            2)if event is triggered before timer ends, time restarts.
            3)func executes only after timer has finished wihtout interruptions.
            4)must clean each deprecated timeout or they will all finish executing and the debounce will be useless.
        WHEN
            1)search input
            2)button click prevention
            3)windowx resize
    C-hooks library
        usehooks-ts.com
    Tip when determining where to locate hooks or functions
        Look at where you already have access to data
        EXAMPLE
            debouncesearchtext can be in app b/c searchtext is already there.
    SetTimeout in Reac
        Accumulated timeouts will execute.

        SOLUTION
            Removal of each of the unnecessary calls. 
            1)store id of each
            2)return a function that executes clearTimeout with that id.
    Non-Null Assertion (!)
        The non-null assertion operator (!) tells TypeScript:
            “I am 100% sure this value is NOT null or undefined.”
            Use with caution—it bypasses TypeScript’s safety checks.
        HOW TO USE
            cases in which type is something | null as substitute for guard clause
        GOOD EXAMPLE
            Inside react query query-fn to avoid guard clausing the number | null activeID
    Sending complex info as prop
        If it is a list, and you are rendering a component, send the entire object as an item and destructure on the other side. 
    Typing API Resp
        Use Promise Generic
            Promise<>
        Type your data
           Type = Data 
        Use the data as the type for the Promise Generic
            Promise<Data>
    Using !resp.ok
        Can save you an unnecessary guard clause.
        HOW
            If fetch depends on paramater that can be null: data | null, it handles this case for you.
        RESULTING TYPE NARROW
            Allows ts too infer that null case is handled, and data will always be truthy
    what browser does in the 500 errors
        Automatically throws Error() like we do in the other server codes\
    Possibility of undefined, methods depending on value being array 
        ?. optional chain
        Establishing the undefined case means type will be type | undefined
            PROBLEM
                In the other side, data has not been typed as counting the undefined scenario
            SOLUTION
                Short circuit ||
                    if undefined || [] / 0
    Unknown ts type
        opposite of any, can't do anything, everything throws errors.
        WHY
            type of paramter for the onError function of React Query can be anything even though react hot toast expects a specific type.
            FIX
                Ts needs to specifically know what it is dealing with at all times.
                Type narrow 
            EXTRA DATA
                React Query new versions make the error parameter the default Error object type.
    Client vs server side pagination
        client
            Implemented client, all calculations done on the clien
            Receive entire package of data
            can slow down the client if too much data
        server
            server only sends the data for that page, fetches every page.
            better for massive data
    Ts literal + union type good use
        const [sortBy, setSortBy] = useState<'relevant' | 'recent'>('relevant')
    [...(jobItems || [])]
        for mutating methods its best to destructure and create a new
        must guard for undefined case and assure that an empty array will be returned []
        Better to mutate so reference to variable changes and useMemo is not affected
    Can use variables to send booleans as props
        isActive={sortOption === "relevant"}
    e.stopPropagation() special anchor behavior
        e.preventDefault()
    LS in useEffect
        IF NOT
            async nature of state will make it really hard to have properly synced.
        IF 
            Will be in sync without much hastle
    Function as initial value in useState
        BENEFIT
            Only runs on mount, avoids needless computation on every re render.
            Performance benefits.
    Typing a prop and passing that data + more
        Ts will not complain as long as what was specified is included minimum
        You can configure ts too complain
    e.target.closest(".classname")
        Returns true if event comes from within the element with the classname provided
    Refs
        Passing a ref as a prop and consuming
            1)ref is received separate from props
            2)must wrap component in forwarefRef(function(props, ref){
            })
        Type the ref
            Generics in the function provided by react
                forwardRef<HTMLDivElement>
        Type the prop
            forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, {here}
        Irony in placement
            typing
                ref = 1 
                props = 2
            function parameters
                props = 1
                ref =2 
    Indicating a required parameter will not be used
        _
        function(_, ref)
        This way the eslint or ts error message will stop appearing.
    Features so common there are custom hooks already
        1)useDebounce()
        2)useLocalStorage()
        3)useClickOutside()
    Trick when refactoring a function into a custom hook
        Generalize the already specific result
    createPortal
        Way to locate pop ups and popovers in the entire document.body while still having them in the component they should be in.
    Wrapper for reusable Component
        Create a wrapper and render reusable component inside to provide the data through props
        Implementation
            App
                <JobListSearch/>
            JobListSearch
                Data
                    const {isLoading, jobItemsSliced} = useJobItemsContext()
                Render
                    <JobList jobItems={jobItemsSliced} isLoading={isLoading} />
            BookmarkPopover
                Data
                    const { bookmarkedJobItems, isLoading } = useBookmarkedIdsContext();
                Render
                    <JobList jobItems={bookmarkedJobItems} isLoading={isLoading} />
    Efficiency = avoid unnecessary
        1)re renders
            a)context and encapsulation with states 
        2)calculations
            a)use memo to avoid calculating unless dependencies change
        3)functions affecting calculations / states
            a)use callback to avoid functions being created on every re render
    Importance of updating objects and arrays with new ones
        If done on the original (ex: sorting), the reference to that variable does not change. 
        MEANING
            Dependencies will not be triggered by the change in it, b/c they will register as if it is the same.
    UseState new updated value 
        Accesible only in new render, that is why console logs previous value first.
    useRef
        If no state is used to cause re render, we will log new value for useRef but the UI will never show that value.
        The only thing that causes re renders is state
    useCallback
        Functions get recreated on every re render, even if they dont change when memoized, they will cause a re calculation and that will cause a re render.
    useMemo
        Don't re calculate value unless dependencies change to avoid app getting stuck.

REACT DISSADVANTAGES
    1)Has to execute the js code and this becomes invisible to the search bots
    2)iniiial paint high load times

HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW 
    Abstracts away a lot of the network boundary when server side rendering.
    No need to think about a route and serving the html in a traditional manner. 

BENEFITS
    1)Abstracts and auto configures tooling like bundling, compiling and more. 
    2)Allows to spend more time on building rather than configuring.

    ROUTING
    App routing system based on react server components.

    HOW
        Uses folders instead of files to to define routes.
        MATCHING
            Uses a page.js/tsx file inside a folder to represent the route
        ROOT ROUTE
            /app
            ├── page.js             # Renders at "/"
        ROUTES
            ├── about
            │   ├── page.js         # Renders at "/about"
        DYNAMIC ROUTE
            ├── blog
            │   ├── page.js         # Renders at "/blog"
            │   ├── [id]
            │   │   ├── page.js     # Renders at "/blog/:id"

        Dynamic Routes
            When you don't know the exact segment names ahead of time and want to create routes from dynamic data, you can use Dynamic Segments that are filled in at request time or prerendered at build time.

            CREATING DYNAMIC SEGMENT
                A Dynamic Segment can be created by wrapping a folder's name in square brackets: [folderName]. For example, [id] or [slug].

            USING THE DYNAMIC SEGMENT
                Dynamic Segments are passed as the params prop to layout, page, route, and generateMetadata functions.

                EXAMPLE
                    export default async function Page({
                        params,
                        }: {
                        params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
                        }) {
                        const { slug } = await params
                        return <div>My Post: {slug}</div>
                    }
        
                GTK
                    Since the params prop is a promise. You must use async/await or React's use function to access the values.


    
        LAYOUT
            The new root component(main.js) rendering {children} that are all the pages.
                    
            REUSABLE ELEMENTS
                This is the component that will have elements like header and footer.

                EXAMPLE(in layout.tsx)
                    return (<>
                        <Header/>
                        {children}
                        <Footer/>
                        </>
                    )

        NESTED LAYOUTS(Different Layouts for Different Sections)
            You can create nested layouts for specific sections (e.g., blog/ has its own layout).

            EXAMPLE
                app/blog/layout.js (Only for Blog Pages)

                export default function BlogLayout({ children }) {
                    return (
                        <section>
                        <h1>Blog Section</h1>
                        {children}
                        </section>
                    );
                }

                Folder structure
                    /vans
                        /deprecated
                            page.tsx(page to render in /vans/deprecate route)
                    layout.tsx(will share components between all pages in the vans folder)
                    page.tsx(main page to render in /vans route)
                        
        SPECIAL FILES
            layout
            pages
            template

            2)useRouter hook (Client Components)
            3)redirect function (Server Components)
            4)Using the native History API

        LINK COMPONENT
            The <Link> component is still used for client-side navigation.
            Does not require to=, just href=.

            EXAMPLE
                import Link from "next/link";
                
                export default function Navbar() {
                return (
                    <nav>
                    <Link href="/">Home</Link>
                    <Link href="/about">About</Link>
                    <Link href="/blog">Blog</Link>
                    </nav>

                    Meaning most of the work is done when actually clicking it.
                2)Does not work with external link, need anchor tag.

        USEROUTER()
            The useRouter hook allows you to programmatically change routes from Client Components.

            EXAMPLE
                'use client'
                import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'
                
                export default function Page() {
                const router = useRouter()
                
                return (
                    <button type="button" onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard')}>
                    Dashboard
                    </button>
                )
            }
        redirect function
            For Server Components, use the redirect function instead.

            EXAMPLE
                For Server Components, use the redirect function instead.

                 const team = await fetchTeam(id)
                if (!team) {
                    redirect('/join')
                }

        Navigation functions
            usePathname()
                usePathname is a Client Component hook that lets you read the current URL's pathname.

                RETURNS
                    usePathname returns a string of the current URL's pathname. For example: '/'

                EXAMPLE
                    'use client'
 
                    import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'
                    
                    export default function ExampleClientComponent() {
                    const pathname = usePathname()
                    return <p>Current pathname: {pathname}</p>
                    }
        

    
2)METADATA
    Metadata in Next.js helps define SEO-related information, such as page titles, descriptions, Open Graph (OG) tags, and favicons.

    Ways next provides to handle metadata
        1)static
            Defined in metadata object in page or layout
            HOW
                React has predefined interfaces that convert that object to the required html. As long as the html exists, you can write the property and provide the values.
        2)dynamic
            using generatemetadata for dynamic values
        
    FAVICON
        Whatever has "favicon.ico" name inside the src folder will be the default favicon for the page.

    METADATA TYPE
        
    
3)STYLING
    TAILWIND CSS
        Nextjs already integrates tailwind.css and removes configuration.

        BENEFIT OF TAILWIND
            Dictionary of classed already created, just use them.

        

4)<IMAGE/>
    Provides custom tag which is optimized replacement for standard HTMl <img> tag.

    FEATURES
        1)optimized loading
        2)automatic resizing
        3)performance boost 
        4)blur replacement
        5)built in responsive support

    HOW TO USE
        import Image from "next/image";

        <Image (REQUIRDE PROPERTIES) 
            src="/my-image.jpg" // Local image in the public/ folder 
            alt="My beautiful image"
            width={500} // Image width in pixels
            height={300} // Image height in pixels
      />
    LOCAL
        To use a local image, import your .jpg, .png, or .webp image files from your public folder.

        import Image from 'next/image'
        import profilePic from './me.png'

        <Image
            src={profilePic}
            alt="Picture of the author"
            // width={500} automatically provided
            // height={500} automatically provided
            // blurDataURL="data:..." automatically provided
            // placeholder="blur" // Optional blur-up while loading
        />

    PROPS
        FILL
            This makes the image automatically stretch to cover its parent container.
            The parent must have position: relative or another positioning style for it to work.
            Useful when width and height unknown
            assings by default
                position absolute 
                object fit fill 
        
        sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"
            This tells the browser how much space the image should take up at different screen sizes.

            If the viewport width is 1280px or less, the image takes 100% of the viewport width (100vw).
            If the viewport width is greater than 1280px, the image is fixed at 1280px wide.

            BENEFIT
                allows the browser to download iamge real size, without it, it downloads it in the size of the viewport.

        quality
            The quality of the optimized image, an integer between 1 and 100, where 100 is the best quality and therefore largest file size. Defaults to 75.

        priority
            When true, Next.js will preload the image. 
            Lazy loading is automatically disabled for images using priority. 
            
            WHEN TO USE
                You should use the priority property on any image detected as the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) element. 
                It may be appropriate to have multiple priority images, as different images may be the LCP element for different viewport sizes.
            
            




    EXTERNAL
        For remote images (like from a CDN or API), allow them in next.config.js.

        CONFIG FILE
            const nextConfig = {
                images: {
                    remotePatterns: [
                    {
                        protocol: "https",
                        hostname: "example.com", // Change to your image host
                    },
                    ],
                },
            };
        USING IMAGE
            <Image 
                src="https://example.com/image.jpg" 
                alt="External Image"
                width={400} 
                height={250} 
            />
        
5)CLIENT VS SERVER COMPONENTS
    Components designed for specific purposes to improve performance and scalability.

    SERVER COMPONENTS
        Rendered in the server and sent as html to the client.

        NO ACCESS TO BROWSER FEATURES
            1)DOM
            2)events
            3)local state

        BENEFIT
            GET requests
                Off load the get requests in the server
        
        FEATURES
            1)allows to offload more logic to the server, increasing performance in user device
            2)faster load times
            3)can fetch data on the server without client side involvement
            4)can keep large dependencies on the server

        USE CASES
            1)fetch data
            2)access backend resource
            3)access sensitive information(access tokens, api keys)
            4)large dependencies

        WHEN BECOMING A SERVER COMPONENT
            Everything inside the app/ directory are server components by default(CHILDREN as well)

        HOW DOES NEXT ABSTRACT
            1)Manual Routing:
                Next auto routes server components
                Express would need to manually define them
            2)Auto data fetching
                Next server compnents can fetch data and render seemlessly
                Expres needs to manually fetch data and pass it as prop

        FETCHING DATA(GET REQUEST)
            BENEFITS
                1)can console log
                2)no need for useEffect or useState or any hook 
                3)reduce bundle js sent to the client
                4)api keys are a lot more convenient to use
                5)data is stored normally in variables, no hooks
            HOW
                make compononet function async
                    export default async function EventsPage({params}: EventsPageProps) {...}
                fetch normally
                    const response = await fetch(`https://bytegrad.com/course-assets/projects/evento/api/events?city=${city}`)
                    const events = await response.json()
                    console.log(events)

    CLIENT COMPONENT
        Traditional client rendered react component meant for interactity:
            1)click events
            2)form submission
            3)state management

        WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR NEXTJS
            Indication that component will be rendered and executed in the browser.

        FEATURES
            1)rendered on client
            2)access to browser features
                1)dom
                2)events
                3)local state
            3)js to make components interactive

        USE CASES
            1)interactivity
            2)hooks and lifecycle effects

        HOW TO MAKE SOMETHING A CLIENT COMPONENT
            1)IMPORTED COMPONENTS
                Any component imported to a client component will become client component.
            2)SPECIFY 
                To mark as client, add the 'use-client' directive top of the file.
        WHERE TO HAVE CLIENT COMPONENTS 
            Outside edgess of the tree, the leaves.
                
            EXAMPLE
                Button component, nothing that will affect other major components. 

        HOW TO HAVE A SERVER COMPONENT INSIDE A CLIENT COMPONENT
            CHILDREN PROP 
                Using the {children} prop inside a client component WON'T make it a client component.
            
        CONTEXT OF INSTANTIATION
            A component can be rendered in both contexts, being client in 1 instance and server in another. 

    HOW TO HAVE SERVER -> CLIENT -> SERVER
        1)Server -> by default will be 
        2)Client in server1 -> use client 
        3)Server in Client -> render as children prop



6)SERVER ACTIONS(POST,PUT,DELETE)
    Feature that allows to define functions in the server that can be called from the client, to perform server side operations without the need for API routes. 

    BENEFIT
        Meant to replace endpoints that are only used for POST PUT DELETE ACTIONS, unnecesarry and redundnant.

    WHY
        Improve 
            1)experience
            2)performance 
        HOW
            simplifying handling of:   
                1)server side logic 
                2)reducing boilerplate code
        
    FEATURES
        1)no need to api routes
            eliminate need for custom /api/* to handle server logic. 
            logic can be directly defined in sscomponents.
        2)auto server execution
            server actions are auto executed on the server when invoked by the client. 
        3)simplified code
            reduce boilerplate code
        4)rssc integration
            ssa work seemless with rssc, natural extension of that. 

    HOW TO USE
        Mark function with @server
            'use server' directive at top of file to indicate server action. 
        Trigger action from client
            Call the action in the CSC
        Handle response
            Once executed, handle response on the client side.

7)SUSPENSE AND STREAMING
    Cutting edge features that leverage the latest advancement in React for working with SSR

    WHY
        1)optimize performance
        2)improve UX 

    SUSPENSE
        Allows to delay rendering of component until some async data is ready. 

        WHY
            Prevents the UI from rendering incomplete components

        HOW DOES IT WORK
            Wraps a component that may include async logic and provides a fallback to render in its place. 

            EXAMPLE
                <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>
                    <ProductList />
                </Suspense>

        NEXT JS
            Loading.tsx
                Special file in next to tell it that it is the fallback while something is loading.
            
            By using the loading component, next js automatically wraps the page in a suspense and provides the loading as fallback.

        USE CASE
            Show the page and suspense the component with the fetch that takes time to finish.

    STREAMING
        Rendering content progressively from the server as it becomes available rather than waiting for the entire page to be ready before sending it to the client.

        WHY
            Allows the user to start interacting with it while other parts are still being fetched. 

        HOW
            React Suspense + React Server Components
        
        BENEFITS
            1)Faster TTI 
            2)optimized SSR
            3)less blocking

    COMPLEMENTATION OF BOTH
        Suspense
            handles async data fetching smoothly 
        Streaming
            progressively delivers the rendered content from the server

8)CHACHING
    Instant auto caching on client of fetch requests. 

    REMOVES
        1)after 5min
        2)onReload

    SPECIFY IN THE LITERAL FETCH REQUEST AS AN OPTION PARAM (only works in nextjs) 
        {
            cache: "no-cache"
        }
    SPECIFY WHEN TO REFETCH 
        {
            next:{
                revalidate: 3600
            }
        }

    TYPES OF CACHE IN SERVER
        1)data cache
            Even if component needs to be rendered again, data will persist. 
        2)full route cache
            means the page and all its children compoonents will not run every time and will be frozen
    
9)STATIC & DYNAMIC RENDERING
    STATIC(prod)
        Only runs during build
    DYNAMIC(dev)
        Runs every time the route is accessed.

        HOW TO FORCE A COMPONENT TO BE DYNAMIC
            export const dynamic = "force-dynamic" at top of file
10)MIDDLEWARE
    Something to run before the request hits the server

    USE CASE
        1)check if logged in 
    
    EXAMPLE
        export function middleware(request: NexRequest) {
            const isAuthenticated = false
            if(!isAuthenticated) {
                return NextResponse.redirect("/login")
            }
            return NextResponse.next()
        }

    AUTH LIBRARIES
        1)kinde
        2)nextAuth

11)FOLDER STRUCTURE
    ...
12)PRODUCTION: BUILD AND DEPLOYING
    STATIC EXPORT
        Only html, css, js files

        HOW
            next.config.js file
                output: "export" 
                unoptimized: true

        DOWNSIDE
            Loss in all server features

    NEXTJS app = nodejs app
        
    .NEXT folder
        Folder with the build app

    .env (can be uploaded)
        DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
    
    .env.local(private)
        To be protected always

13)@/path
    starts at the source folder so it is easier to know what is being imported and from where

    DEFIND IN TSCONFIG
        "paths": {
            "@/*": ["./src/*"]
        }

TYPE OVER INTERFACE
    1)intersection instead of extension
    2)all data types
    3)unions
    4)utility types
    5)tuples
    6)not merged like interfaces(by redeclaration)
    7)

            animations
            variants
            gestures
    7)tailwind merge
        is a utility function that helps resolve class conflicts when using Tailwind CSS. It's commonly used to merge and deduplicate conflicting Tailwind classes dynamically.

        why
            1)Avoids Conflicting Classes
            2)Improves Code Readability & Maintainability
            3)Helpful in Dynamic Styling
            4)combines with clsx
        
        EXAMPLE
            <h1 className={twMerge("text-3xl lg:text-6xl font-bold tracking-tight", className)}>{children}</h1>
    8)cn()
        The cn function (short for "class names") is a utility function often used in React + Tailwind CSS projects to manage class names dynamically. It helps merge, conditionally apply, and deduplicate Tailwind classes.

        EXAMPLE
            import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";
            import clsx, { ClassValue } from "clsx";

            export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
                return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
            }
        clsx(): Handles conditional class logic (e.g., isActive && "bg-blue-500").
        twMerge(): Deduplicates and resolves conflicting Tailwind classes.

    style active link
        determine current link
            onst activePathname = usePathname()

            Does the pathname Cause a Re-render?
                Yes, changing the pathname in a React app will trigger a re-render if it's being used inside a component.
        clsx
            className={clsx("hover:text-white hover:scale-110 transition", {
            "text-white": activePathname === route.path,
            "text-white/50":activePathname !== route.path
        })}
        framer motion
            activePathname === route.path && <motion.div layoutId="header-active-link" className="bg-accent h-1 w-full absolute bottom-0"></motion.div>

            Shared layout animation 
                framer motion is able to detect the two creations of the motion.div between renders and transitionate smoothly between them by the id.
3)search form, converting server to client component
    create handlesubmit function
        const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
            e.preventDefault();
        };
    controlling input
        const [search, setSearch] = useState("")
        onChange={(e) => setSearch(e.target.value)}
        value={search}
    convert to client
        create a dedicated SearchForm component and 'use client'
            
        when to convert
            1)use a hook
            2)hook into event
    link to the router through the search when enter event
        useRouter
            Allows to programmatically change routes inside the client components.

            Gives you access to router-related information and functions, allowing you to:
                1)Access the current URL (pathname, query, etc.)
                2)Navigate programmatically (push, replace, back, etc.)
                3)Listen for route changes and execute logic on navigation

            USE
                import {useRouter} from "next/navigation"
                const router = useRouter()
                router.push(`/events/${search}`)

Resusable H1 component
    Component will be the same regardless of page. 

    Scrollbar 
        Added permanent scroll page in home and events pages with different stles.

    Making H1 text dynamic
        Retrieve the city
            PROBLEM
                usePathname can only be used in client components
            SOLUTION
                params in a server component

                function EventsPage({params}: EventsPageProps) {
                    const {city} = params
        Type the params
            type Params = {
                city: string
            }

            type EventsPageProps = {
                params: Params
            }
        Capitalize the city 
            <H1>Events in {city.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + city.substring(1)}</H1>
        
Fetch Data in EventsPage
    const response = await fetch(`https://bytegrad.com/course-assets/projects/evento/api/events?city=${city}`)
    const events = await response.json()
    console.log(events)

Evento Type
    WHERE TO PLACE types folder
        remember app is focused on routes and server components

        outside app
            lib
                types
                hooks
                constants

    TYPE
        export type Evento = {
            id: number,
            name: string,
            slug: string,
            city: string,
            location: string,
            date: Date,
            organizerName: string,
            imageUrl: string,
            description: string
        }

Events List
    Create list component
    Type list component
    @path import
    
Events Card
    
            
        
        
        

    
        
            
        

    


    

            
            
    

        
            

                
LEARNED SUMMARY
    Always wrap inputs in form
        No matter where they are, an input should never go without a form.
    Content Layout Shift(CLS)
        Shifting of content when rendering.
    Nav usage
        where the links are located, this could mean leaving the logo outside.
    React & next nav links
        Information is extracted away in arrays to map
    small tag
        auto smaller font size compared to parent element
    condition for m-auto to work
        parent must be flex container in order to full utilize entire height with min-h-screen
    bigger screens
        more padding
        more space between elements
    Work methodology
        hardcored and then dynamic
    making sure lists are good
        just render the raw data without the styling and components
    Sending complex info as prop
        If it is a list, and you are rendering a component, send the entire object as an item and destructure on the other side. 
    flex shorthand default
        flex-grow: 0: Flex items do not grow to fill the available space.
        flex-shrink: 1: Flex items can shrink to fit into the container.
        flex-basis: auto: The initial size of the flex items is based on their content.
    flex 1
        flex-grow: 1;
        flex-shrink: 1;
        flex-basis: 0%;
    using flex 1
        suppose you have 2 children in a flex parent
        1 has a fixed height and the other flex 1, that will grow to fill the rest of the container.
    absolute with relative
        for an absolute positioned element, remember it depends on the closest parent relative element
    creating custom Date with new Date() and methods 
        const date = new Date(event.date)
        {date.toLocaleDateString("en-US", {day: "2-digit"})}
        {date.toLocaleDateString("en-US", {month: "short"})}
    animations and transitions
        hover:scale[105] -> slightly bigger
        transition -> smooths out the effect
        active:scale-[1.02]
    aspects of page being navigation elements
        WRAP everything in LINK or ANCHOR
    overflow hidden uses
        sometimes overflow hidden can fix images or things going crazy and bigger
